/**
 * The set [1,2,3,…,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.
 * <p/>
 * By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,
 * We get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3):
 * <p/>
 * "123"
 * "132"
 * "213"
 * "231"
 * "312"
 * "321"
 * Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.
 * <p/>
 * Note: Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
