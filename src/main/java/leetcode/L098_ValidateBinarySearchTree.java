 * Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

 * Assume a BST is defined as follows:
 * <p/>
 * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
 * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
 * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
